Front-end for an articles API with user and article CRUD and user auth -->

# React + Vite

## Live Demo

https://front-end-react-article.netlify.app/

- React project plan and architecture
	- For basic blog/articles API with user auth
		- backend won't be real just yet, so we need to fake the API interactions
	- Layouts with React Router
		- need to figure out the routes that we want
	- Deployed to Netlify
		- Remember to do the redirects file for Netlify to make routing work!
